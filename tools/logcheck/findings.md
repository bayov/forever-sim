# Log audit findings

What the log audit found that we haven't settled yet. The `log-audit` skill fills it in every
hour while its session is open, and we go through it together on `/log-audit` (the skill's
sections 2 and 6 have the format).

## Fix in the sim

### Fire Nova rank 1 keeps its full coefficient at 36 to 39

- **Flag**: `Fire Nova (408423): raw`, mob levels 26 to 42, 4 windows.
- **Windows**: `WoWCombatLog-110726_203718.txt 21:55:17` (level 36 to 39, 38 spell power): log 40.2 avg in 56 hits, sim 37.3. Every window from level 26 to 42 has the log at about 40.0.
- **What we think**: full coefficient gives 35.0 + 0.143 x 38 = 40.4, the log. The sim's downranking penalty (`sim/core/downrank.go`, rank learned at 12, so 50% at 39) gives 37.7, the sim. This is the newer low rank log the "Forever's downranking penalty" Need to Verify item asked for, and it says no penalty at a 27 level gap. Windows at levels 18 to 25 have the log about 1.5 below the sim (33.0 vs 34.5), cause unknown.
- **Next step**: the user's ruling on the penalty (drop it, or shrink it). The reduced proc chance part isn't modelled either way.
- **Status**: open, first seen 2026-11-08, last updated 2026-11-08.

### Two Forever enchants changed under the same ID

- **Flag**: `sheet` (Stamina -2, Health -15 from level 12 on).
- **Windows**: every Nov 5-8 window from level 12.
- **What we think**: enchant 41 went from +5 Health to +2 Stamina and 66 from +1 to +3 Stamina in the Forever client. The sim's `db.json` still has the old values. logcheck now takes the client's stats when they differ, so the audit no longer shows it, but the sim's own gear does.
- **Next step**: refresh the enchants from the client (`/update-sources`), or fix the two by hand.
- **Status**: open, first seen 2026-11-08, last updated 2026-11-08.

### Orc shaman base stats a point or two off

- **Flag**: `sheet` (Strength +1 to 2, Agility -1 to 2, Intellect -1 to 2 at most levels).
- **Windows**: Nov 5-8, most windows, small residue left after the buffs.
- **What we think**: Forever's Orc shaman base rows differ from the sim's 1.12 rows (`sim/core/base_stats.go`). It may also explain the level 6 "Watching" finding.
- **Next step**: read the base rows from a few unbuffed sheets at different levels and compare row by row.
- **Status**: open, first seen 2026-11-08, last updated 2026-11-08.

## Collect more data

### Dungeon mobs take about 2 less spell damage per hit

- **Flag**: `Flame Shock (8050/8053/10447)` ticks and direct `raw`, `Lightning Shield (26365..26369): raw`, `Earth Shock (8045): raw`, only in dungeon windows.
- **Windows**: Nov 5-8 dungeon runs (Wailing Caverns, Shadowfang Keep, Razorfen Kraul, Gnomeregan): Flame Shock rank 2 ticks 12 to 10, rank 4 ticks 26 to 24, direct 54 to 52 and 101 to 99, orbs 24 to 22-23. Open world mobs of the same level, same hour: full damage.
- **What we think**: a dungeon mob trait, not our spell power. New Need to Verify item under "All classes".
- **Next step**: Flame Shock a dungeon trash mob and an open world mob of the same level, 30 ticks each.
- **Status**: open, first seen 2026-11-08, last updated 2026-11-08.

## logcheck issues

### Buffs at export time make the sheet higher than the sim

- **Flag**: `sheet` (31 of 31 windows), `Melee: raw` (24), `Stormstrike (17364): raw` (13), small spell raw rows like Flame Shock rank 4 +1.
- **Windows**: e.g. 07:42:29 on Nov 5: Stamina -6 (Stamina scroll +4, Rock Skin +2), AP -28.5 (Blessing of Might +25, Well Fed), crit -1.9 (Camp Benefits, whose chair part is +2% crit and isn't in the buff list). Devotion Aura or the Armor scroll explain Armor -150 to -194, Blessing of Kings the big Nov 7 stat gaps. The AP gap explains the white damage gap (AP/14 x 3.3 = +6.7 expected, +6.5 seen), and Stormstrike's formula holds once the AP from white hits is used.
- **Window** `WoWCombatLog-110826_085019.txt 21:00:57-21:17:14` (levels 36 to 43, Mograine's Might): the sheet runs the other way, AP +424 in the sim, because the export was taken in Ghost Wolf (buffs: Well-Rested, Ghost Wolf). The fight still shows the usual gap: Melee raw 386.4 in 31 hits vs the sim's 365.6 at level 41, Stormstrike 581.1 in 15 hits vs 559.9, Flame Shock rank 4 ticks 47 vs 46.3 and direct 179 vs 178. So a sheet taken in a form says nothing about the fight, and the AP for damage rows should come from the window's white hits.
- **What we think**: history records carry `buffs` and the sheet check now lists them, but logcheck doesn't add their stats to the sim. Other players' Blessing of Might mid-window also moves AP (244 to 271 in 06:37).
- **Next step**: add the stats of the buffs up at export time to the sim's character (a table of the common ones), or compare the sheet against the sim plus those buffs, and take the AP for damage rows from the window's white hits.
- **Status**: open, first seen 2026-11-08, last updated 2026-11-08 (hourly run, Ghost Wolf window).

### BayovCore cuts the gear list short

- **Flag**: none now (logcheck works around it).
- **Windows**: history records 194, 198 and 234 (Nov 5) lost the gloves, cloak and main hand; fourteen Nov 7 logins lost the relic (slot 18).
- **What we think**: `isArray` in BayovCore's `Modules/Export.lua` writes the gear table as a list cut at the first gap. `historyGear` in `tools/logcheck/history.go` now keeps the slots a login's list dropped.
- **Next step**: fix `isArray` in the addon so it always writes an object.
- **Status**: open, first seen 2026-11-08, last updated 2026-11-08.

## Watching

### Sheet Attack power and Dodge a bit high at level 6

- **Flag**: `sheet` (Attack power +0.50, Dodge % +0.12).
- **Windows**:
  - `WoWCombatLog-101626_165126.txt 23:45:55-23:59:16` (`Player-4620-01872808`, level 6). The sheet has AP 97 and Dodge 4.43%, but the sim has 97.5 and 4.55%. Every other sheet row matches, Armor 170 included.
- **What we think**: the sim's own base stats at low level, not logcheck. The half point of AP may be the game rounding AP down. The dodge may be the Agility to dodge ratio at level 6 (`sim/core/base_stats.go`). The AP moves Melee raw damage by about 0.1, and our dodge doesn't touch our damage rows.
- **Next step**: see if it comes back at other levels. If it does, check the AP rounding and the dodge per Agility by level.
- **Status**: open, first seen 2026-10-18, last updated 2026-10-18.

## Done

### Spell damage rolls round to nearest, the sim rolled evenly

- **Flag**: `Attack (3606/6350/6351): raw` (Searing Totem), about 0.5 low in the sim.
- **Done**: 2026-11-08 (in the working copy, goldens still to update). The engine never floored: the floor is logcheck's `toWhole`, which matches the log's raw field for steady hits (8.8 shows 8). The game rolls whole points: 3606 (9 to 11) hit 9 / 10 / 11 on 193 / 370 / 203 bolts, and amount equals raw on those, so nothing fractional rides on the roll. 6350 and 6352 show the same half weight ends. `sim.Roll` now rounds its roll to the nearest point, and the spell power bonus comes on top, so logcheck's floor gives the game's raw. Averages stay the same for whole ranges (goldens move by under 0.4%). After `-redo` the 3606 raw flags went from 36 to 5 and 6350 from 39 to 18. What's left is the dungeon mobs (Wailing Caverns, see "Dungeon mobs take about 2 less") and 6351 about 3 high (separate). Melee is unchanged (its own random source): our white swings at one attack power don't form a flat range, so their ends tell nothing.

### Flametongue Attack never fired in the sim

- **Flag**: `Flametongue Attack (10444/29469/29470): never` and `procs`.
- **Done**: 2026-11-08. The sim keys the imbue proc under Flametongue Weapon's rank, the log under Flametongue Attack. `nameAliases` in `tools/logcheck/report.go` now pairs them. After `-redo` the never and procs rows are gone, a raw row is left in 3 windows (the AP and spell power gap above).

### Earth Shock raw about 20% high in the sim

- **Flag**: `Earth Shock (8045/8046/10412): raw`.
- **Done**: 2026-11-08. The game leaves the Stormstrike mark out of the log's raw field (amount over raw is 1.004 with no Stormstrike before it, 1.202 right after one), but the sim put it in the spell's multiplier. `applyStormstrike` in `sim/shaman/stormstrike.go` now adds the mark after the damage calc for Earth Shock, Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, with the same damage and threat (shaman tests unchanged). After `-redo` Earth Shock 10412 went from 6 windows to 1 and 8046 cleared.

### Wrong character from history and items

- **Flag**: `sheet`, `Melee: raw` (31 vs 3.0 in `110526_011432 02:53:44`, the sim swung unarmed).
- **Done**: 2026-11-08. logcheck keeps gear slots a history list dropped (`historyGear`), uses the client's enchant stats when the sim's differ, adds Forever random suffixes from the item link's bonus IDs (`ItemBonus`, `RandPropPoints`), and falls back to the export's main-hand imbue when the log has no imbue proc (Rockbiter: AP gap -103.5 to -10.5 in 10:49 Nov 5).

### Rotation and fight differences

- **Done**: 2026-11-08. Into `known.json`: Searing Totem `procs` (the sim's player barely melees) and Earthbind `never` / `procs` (we drop it by hand), plus the Oct 21 Earth Shock 8042 and Lightning Bolt 403 `raw` rows (the log predates hotfix 113380, and the old rank 1 values fit it exactly). Single absorbs, partial resists, immunes (Nature-immune mobs) and evades are noise.

### Audit stops on a history record whose gear is a JSON array

- **Flag**: none. The whole `-audit` run exits before any window runs, so nothing new gets checked.
- **Windows**: all. Error: `~/forever-logs/history/Player-6940-0038ED1A.jsonl:194: json: cannot unmarshal array into Go struct field historyRecord.gear of type map[string]jsontext.Value`. The record is dated 2026-11-05 02:49:32. Its `gear` is `[null,null,null,{...Primitive Mantle...},...]`.
- **What we think**: the addon saves the gear as a Lua table. When the low slots are empty (a new character), the table has no string keys and serializes as an array with nulls, not an object. `historyRecord.Gear` in `tools/logcheck/history.go` is a `map[string]json.RawMessage`, so it rejects the array.
- **Next step**: let `Gear` take both shapes (decode an array into slot keys "1".."n", skipping nulls), or make the addon always write an object. Then rerun `-audit`.
- **Done**: 2026-11-08. `historyGear` in `tools/logcheck/history.go` now takes both shapes (an array becomes slots "1".."n", nulls skipped). The audit then ran, but 4 windows failed with `SpellItemEnchantment.csv: EOF`, because parallel windows downloaded the same wago table and one read it half written. `download` in `tools/logcheck/wago.go` now writes a temporary file and renames it, and `-audit` reruns a window whose last run failed (`tools/logcheck/audit.go`).

### Low level gear missing from the sim's database

- **Flag**: `sheet`, and `Melee: raw` at mob levels 6 and 7.
- **Windows**:
  - `WoWCombatLog-101626_165126.txt 23:45:55-23:59:16` (Bayov-Oom, `Player-4620-01872808`, level 6). The sheet has Armor 170 and AP 97, but the sim has 38 and 48. Melee raw damage is 28.9 avg in 32 hits at level 6 and 30.4 in 18 hits at level 7. The sim's is 3.0 at both levels.
- **What we think**: logcheck built the wrong character. All 9 worn items are left off as "not in the sim's database": Primitive Mantle (154), Ragged Leather Vest (1364), Belt (1369), Boots (1367) and Bracers (1370), Dust-covered Leggings (4921), Battleworn Leather Gloves (4914), Flimsy Chain Cloak (2652) and Primitive Walking Stick (5778). So the sim swings unarmed (3 damage), with too little armor and AP. The sim's item DB leaves out the grey and white starter gear a new character wears. `character.equip` in `tools/logcheck/export.go` skips any item missing from `core.ItemsByID`. Every new character's first windows will flag like this, so their Melee rows don't tell us anything about the sim. The outcome rows and Earth Shock fit.
- **Next step**: When an item is missing from the DB, have `equip` build it from the client's item tables (logcheck already loads them for the wago build). It needs the weapon damage, speed, armor and stats. Another option is to add the low level items to the sim's DB. Until then, the audit could skip a window whose weapon is missing instead of flagging it.
- **Done**: 2026-10-18. gen_db already builds these items, but it writes the grey and white gear and anything below item level 10 to `assets/database/leftover_db.bin`, which only the UI loads. logcheck now adds the leftover items to the sim's item table at startup (`addLeftoverItems` in `tools/logcheck/export.go`). They match the sheet: Kolkar Hammer 5-11 at 2.4 speed, and Armor 170 = 170 at 23:45. With `-redo` the window's `Melee: raw` flag is gone. Only Primitive Mantle (154) is still left off. It's a shirt with no stats.
